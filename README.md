Tutorial: [Connecting to Offchain Data with Oracles](https://solana.com/developers/courses/connecting-to-offchain-data/oracles)

The oracle used in the tutorial is outdated and has undergone significant updates, making it unusable as-is. Attempts to use the new version were unsuccessful, as the code fails to run, with anchor test reporting errors related to missing fork functionality. As a result, the focus was shifted to learning the principles outlined in the tutorial.
